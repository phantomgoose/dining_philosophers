# Dining Philosophers
Concurrency practice in Rust. Inspired by [Google's Rust book](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/exercises/concurrency/dining-philosophers.html).

Solution is similar to the _Breaking Hold-and-wait_ approach described [here](https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/kirkpams/OpenCSF/Books/csf/html/DiningPhil.html).
